Description: hiAnnotator contains set of functions which allow users to
    annotate a RangedData object with custom set of annotations. The basic
    philosophy of this package is to take two RangedData objects (query &
    subject) with common set of space (i.e. chromosomes) and return associated
    annotation per space and rows from the query matching space and rows from
    the subject (i.e. genes or cpg islands). The package comes with three types
    of annotation functions which calculates if a position from query is:
    within a feature, near a feature, or count features in defined window
    sizes. Moreover, one can utilize parallel backend for each annotation
    function to utilize multiple processors. In addition, the package is
    equipped with a wrapper function, which finds appropriate columns needed to
    make a RangedData object from a common data frame.
