Description: hiAnnotator contains set of functions which allow users to
    annotate a RangedData or GRanges object with custom set of annotations. The
    basic philosophy of this package is to take two RangedData or GRanges
    objects (query & subject) with common set of space/seqnames (i.e.
    chromosomes) and return associated annotation per space and rows from the
    query matching space and rows from the subject (i.e. genes or cpg islands).
    The package comes with three types of annotation functions which calculates
    if a position from query is: within a feature, near a feature, or count
    features in defined window sizes. Moreover, one can utilize parallel
    backend for each annotation function to utilize multiple processors. In
    addition, the package is equipped with a wrapper function, which finds
    appropriate columns needed to make a RangedData or GRanges object from a
    common data frame.
